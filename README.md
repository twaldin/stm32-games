## Games with STM32 + ST7789 
This project is for mt personal experimentation with stm32f103c8 microcontroller and some screen that uses a st7789 spi controller. Currently only contains snake game

### Requirements
This project uses an st7789 **[driver](https://github.com/abhra0897/stm32f1_st7789_spi)** which requires the **[libopencm3](https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3)** library to use. 

clone libopencm3 into the project root and use 'make' inside the libopencm3 directory to use
